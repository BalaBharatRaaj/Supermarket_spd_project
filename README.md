# Supermarket Billing System

## Outline
 * Paper bills are now the primary channel of communication between companies and their customers.
 * However, their potential for personalization is limited, and they are not interactive. 
 * If a customer wants to react to something in his paper bill – for example, to make a customer service inquiry or to order a new service – he must make a telephone call. Internet  Billing promises far more than a new and inexpensive way to deliver billing information. 
 * Industry experts predict that Internet Billing will fundamentally change the way companies interact with their customers. 
 * Eventually, the Internet Bill will be an interactive entry to a host of additional services including customer self-care, automated sales one-to one marketing. 
 * The Internet Bill will become the gateway through which customers and companies have electronic one to one dialogs. 
 * The project has various functionality in order to achive less cumbersome biling facility at the shop.
